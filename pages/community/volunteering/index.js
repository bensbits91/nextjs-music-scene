                The Claremont Music Scene is made possible by a network of like-minded people collaborating
                together. This is a central hub where
                you can find and connect with others around shared interests. Maybe you've considered hosting a jam
                session. Perhaps you have
                an idea for teaching a class: beginning synth, or make your own junkyard intruments, or learning
                rhythm via Steve Reich's
                Clapping Music. Yes, we can use more drum circles, children's marching band clubs, and listening
                parties. How about getting a few
                friends together in the park for some Parkaoke - open-air karaoke?
                Let's go out and create the things we want to see, find places to be creative, and lead by example.
            </p><h2 id="want-to-help">Want to Help?</h2><p>We welcome help and support from any person that acting
            in a positive and inclusive direction. If you’ve done something or
            are working on something related to music in our area, let us know and we will do our best to recognize
            and share your efforts to the wider
            community. We also have a more formalized volunteer program that encourages community members to work on
            designated projects
            related to directed efforts within the music scene.</p><h3 id="music-scene-volunteers">Music Scene
            Volunteers</h3><p>Volunteers propose a project to work on for something they’re interested in. (We can
            help) You’re encouraged to own it and make it
            your own experience. There’s no hard commitment but if you can average around one hour per month and
            share a brief update of
            your work you’ll be eligible as an official volunteer. Volunteers will receive or have access to:</p>
